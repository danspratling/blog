  is how to set it up

Netlify CMS is a tool designed by the team at Netlify to handle your content. Its beauty is that everything is handled via your repo, and you don't need to think about a backend as it's handled entirely by Netlify CMS. I'm currently using it in it's most minimal form for my blog (this one) but want to expand my workflow, so we'll be working out how to add draft posts, additional fields and extra pages to the site so we can create something a bit more complex than just a blog if we want to.
