## About me

Hi! I'm Dan, a frontend web developer. I've been coding for 8 years. I'm always looking for new things to learn and i've finally gotten around to putting together a blog to document my progress. Ideally, this will become something of a guide, to help new developers (or just those stuck with something) through the process as so many before have helped me. As developers it's our job to get stuck and power through till we find and answer, or create one ourselves. If this helps just one person then it's done it's job.

## My work

For my career so far i've been working in agency life. I personally find this hard as the tight deadlines make it very difficult to learn new things which has led to a lot of my learning happening in my own time, which has led to the creation of this blog. I also decided i wanted things better documented as a lot of my smaller code playgrounds end up being discarded and could definitely be put to better use.

## My goals

I'm constantly improving myself, so my main goal is to learn. Short term this means increasing my exposure to APIs, becoming more familiar with advanced react concepts, and learning JS testing. Long term, I plan on learning node js to pick up on some backend functionality and generally rounding out my JS knowledge.

My work can all be found here and on [Github](https://github.com/danspratling) if you wish to delve further into how everything goes together (including changes made to this blog). The blog itself will be a playground, housing smaller ideas and i'll try and document all interesting changes I make.

Happy coding!
