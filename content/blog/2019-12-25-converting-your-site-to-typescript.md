# TypeScript: An alternative to JavaScript

Okay, that heading is slightly misleading. TypeScript isn't really an alternative to javascript as it still shares all the same syntax. TypeScript is actually a superset of Javascript. TypeScript's main benefit is ensuring that your javascript variables are type dependent, ensuring your variables are always a single type, whether that be string, number, boolean etc.

This is useful, especially when working in teams as it gives you more confidence in your code by ensuring data is always the correct type. You can even define these types yourself to narrow the selection down even more.

## Is it worth converting to TypeScript?

That depends on your needs. TypeScript has only been adopted fairly recently and plenty of JavaScript solutions before have worked perfectly well without it.
